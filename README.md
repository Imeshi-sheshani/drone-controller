#  üöÅ Drone Telemetry Control System
This project showcases a mobile application integrated with an Arduino-powered system for controlling and monitoring drones in real-time. Using live telemetry data, users can track drone movement, manage direction via servos, and interact with sensor data for responsive control. Ideal for research, learning, and prototyping in drone automation and IoT.
